      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As machine learning models become increasingly powerful and pervasive, concerns about privacy in their deployment have grown. One notable risk comes from &lt;strong&gt;membership inference attacks&lt;/strong&gt;, where an adversary attempts to determine whether a particular data point was used to train a given model. For example, in healthcare, a membership inference attack could reveal if someone participated in a clinical study, threatening patient confidentiality.
This risk motivates my work in this post, where I document my recent experiment investigating the possibility in using cumulative topological distance in membership inference attacks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
